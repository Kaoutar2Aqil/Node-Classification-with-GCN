# Node-Classification-with-GCN

To perform node classification using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in Python, you can use popular libraries like PyTorch Geometric (PyG) or DGL (Deep Graph Library). These libraries provide efficient implementations of graph neural networks and allow you to work directly with graph data.

Node classification is a supervised learning task in which the goal is to assign a label or class to each node in a graph, based on its characteristics and its relationship to other nodes. This task is commonly performed using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which can leverage information from a node's neighbors and the overall structure of the graph to improve classification accuracy.
